# TC-39 Signals JSX

> [!WARNING]  
> This library is theoretically feature complete but has not been tested yet and should be considered a work-in-progress.

This library implements a [DOM Expressions](https://github.com/ryansolid/dom-expressions) runtime using the [TC-39 signals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals) [polyfill](https://github.com/proposal-signals/signal-polyfill). This library provides a way to create web applications with excellent performance profiles using native signals (or any library derived from them) for state management along with JSX for templating, providing all of the features you would expect from a modern front-end JavaScript framework.
